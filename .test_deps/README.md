## Nmap project binaries

### Portable Ncat

Ncat is needed for brokering TCP connections that emulate serial port connections.
This is needed for testing the UAVCAN/serial transport without having to access a physical serial port
(which would be difficult to set up on a CI server).

The binary comes with the following statement by its developers:

> This is a portable (statically compiled) Win32 version of Ncat.
> You should be able to take the ncat.exe and run it on other systems without having to also copy over
> a bunch of DLLs, etc.
>
> More information on Ncat: http://nmap.org/ncat/
>
> You can get the version number of this ncat by runnign "ncat --version".
> We don't create a new Ncat portable for each Ncat release,
> so you will have to compile your own if you want a newer version.
> Instructions for doing so are available at: https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Ncat_Portable
>
> Ncat is distributed under the same free and open source license as Nmap.
> See http://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html.


### Npcap installer

Npcap is needed for testing the network sniffer of the UAVCAN/UDP transport implementation on Windows.
