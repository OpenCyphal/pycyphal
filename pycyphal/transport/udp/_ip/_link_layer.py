    This wrapper is intended to insulate the rest of the transport implementation from the specifics of the
    libpcap wrapper implementation (there are dozens of different wrappers out there).
    Observe that anything libpcap-related shall not be imported outside of these methods because we only require
    this dependency if protocol sniffing capability is needed.
    Regular use of the library should be possible without libpcap installed.

    Once a new instance is constructed, it is launched immediately.
    Execution is carried out in a background daemon thread pool.
    It is required to call :meth:`close` when done, which will hint the worker threads to terminate soon.

    If a new network device is added or re-initialized while the sniffer is running, it will not be recognized.
    Removal or a re-configuration of a device while the sniffer is running may cause it to fail,
    which will be logged from the worker threads.

    Should a worker thread encounter an error (e.g., if the device becomes unavailable), its capture context
    is closed automatically and then the thread is terminated.
    Such occurrences are logged at the CRITICAL severity level.
