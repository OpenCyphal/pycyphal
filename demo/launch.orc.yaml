#!/usr/bin/env -S yakut --verbose orchestrate
# This orchestration file (orc-file) launches the demo app and a simulator of the plant controlled by the thermostat.
# It also starts a couple of diagnostic commands that print certain subjects to the terminal to let you see what is
# happening on the network.
# Read the docs about orc-file syntax: yakut orchestrate --help

  # It is recommended to set unused transports to 'empty' (by making them null-valued) explicitly to ensure that
  # previously stored transport configurations are not accidentally reused.
  # Null-valued registers passed via environment variables are removed from the register file.
