# is that the packages will be re-generated from scratch every time the program is started, which may be undesirable.

# So in this example we select a fixed temp dir name (make sure it's unique enough) and shard its contents by the
# library version. The sharding helps us ensure that we won't attempt to use a package generated for an older library
# version with a newer one, as they may be incompatible.
#
# Another sensible location for the generated package directory is somewhere in the application data directory,
