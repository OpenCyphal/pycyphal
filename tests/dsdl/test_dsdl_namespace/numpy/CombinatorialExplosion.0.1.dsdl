# This data type is crafted to trigger the combinatorial explosion problem: https://github.com/OpenCyphal/pydsdl/issues/23
# The problem is now fixed so we introduce this type to shield us against regressions.
# If DSDL compilation takes over a few minutes, you have a combinatorial problem somewhere in the compiler.

@extent 100 * (1024 ** 2) * 8  # One hundred megabytes should be about right.
