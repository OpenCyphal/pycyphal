        Every received frame shall be timestamped. Both monotonic and system timestamps are required.
        There are no timestamping accuracy requirements. An empty set of frames should never be reported.

        The media implementation shall drop all non-data frames (RTR frames, error frames, etc.).

        If the set contains more than one frame, all frames must be ordered by the time of their arrival,
        which also should be reflected in their timestamps; that is, the timestamp of a frame at index N
        generally should not be higher than the timestamp of a frame at index N+1. The timestamp ordering,
        however, is not a strict requirement because it is recognized that due to error variations in the
        timestamping algorithms timestamp values may not be monotonically increasing.

        The implementation should strive to return as many frames per call as possible as long as that
        does not increase the worst case latency.

        The handler shall be invoked on the event loop returned by :attr:`loop`.

        The transport is guaranteed to invoke this method exactly once during (or shortly after) initialization;
        it can be used to perform a lazy start of the receive loop task/thread/whatever.
        It is undefined behavior to invoke this method more than once on the same instance.

            This mode is used by UAVCAN to facilitate the PnP node-ID allocation process on the client side.
            Its support is not mandatory but highly recommended to avoid excessive disturbance of the bus

        should be rejected by the controller. That is also the recommended default configuration (ignore all frames

        The frames shall be delivered to the bus in the same order. The iterable is guaranteed to be non-empty.

        The method returns when the deadline is reached even if some of the frames could not be transmitted.
        The returned value is the number of frames that have been sent. If the returned number is lower than
        the number of supplied frames, the outer transport logic will register an error, which is then propagated
        upwards all the way to the application level.

        The method should avoid yielding the execution flow; instead, it is recommended to unload the frames
        into an internal transmission queue and return ASAP, as that minimizes the likelihood of inner
        priority inversion. If that approach is used, implementations are advised to keep track of transmission
        deadline on a per-frame basis to meet the timing requirements imposed by the application.
