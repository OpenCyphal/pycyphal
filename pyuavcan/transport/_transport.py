        If the transport does not have a node-ID, this property has the value of None,
        and the transport (and the node that uses it) is said to be in the anonymous mode.
        While in the anonymous mode, some transports may choose to operate in a particular regime to facilitate
        plug-and-play node-ID allocation (for example, a CAN transport may disable automatic retransmission).

        Protip: If you feel like assigning the node-ID after initialization,
        make a proxy that implements this interface and keeps a private transport instance.
        When the node-ID is assigned, the private transport instance is destroyed,
        a new one is implicitly created in its place, and all of the dependent session instances are automatically
        recreated transparently for the user of the proxy.

        """
        If the user desires to perform low-level monitoring of the transport interface at the transport frame level
        (e.g., UDP packets, CAN frames, etc.), this method is used to activate this feature.

        This method puts the transport instance into the "monitoring mode" which does not interfere with its normal
        operation but may dramatically increase the computing load due to the need to process every frame exchanged
        over the network (not just frames that originate or terminate at the local node).
        This usually involves reconfiguration of the local networking hardware (e.g., the network card may be put
        into promiscuous mode, the CAN adapter will have its acceptance filters reconfigured to accept everything,
        etc.).

        The monitoring handler is invoked for every transmitted or received transport frame and, possibly, some
        additional transport-implementation-specific events (e.g., network errors or hardware state changes)
        which are described in the specific transport implementation docs.
        The temporal order of the events delivered to the user may be distorted, depending on the guarantees
        provided by the hardware and its driver.
        This means that if the network hardware sees TX frame A and then RX frame B separated by a very short time
        interval, the user may occasionally see the sequence inverted as (B, A).

        There may be an arbitrary number of monitoring handlers installed; when a new handler is installed, it is
        added to the existing ones, if any.

        If the transport does not support monitoring, this method will have no effect other than flipping the state
        of :attr:`monitoring_enabled` from False to True. Technically, the monitoring protocol, as you can see,
        does not have any requirements to the emitted events, so an implementation that pretends to enter
        the monitoring mode while not actually doing anything other than updating that property is compliant.

        Since monitoring reflects actual network events, deterministic data loss mitigation enabled on the
        local node will make the monitor emit duplicate frames for outgoing transfers (although this is probably
        obvious enough without this elaboration).

        Currently, it is not possible to disable monitoring. Once enabled, it will go on until the transport instance
        is destroyed. This restriction may be lifted in a future release.

            concrete types and what events they represent.
            The callable may be invoked from a different thread so the user should ensure synchronization.
            If the callable raises an exception, it is suppressed and logged.

        the name of the transport class in lower case without the "transport" suffix; e.g:
        ``CANTransport`` -- ``can``, ``SerialTransport`` -- ``serial``.
        The element should contain the name of the OS resource associated with the interface,
        if there is any, e.g., serial port name, network iface name, etc;
        or another element, e.g., further specifying the media layer or similar, which in turn contains the name
        of the associated OS resource in it.
        If it is a pseudo-transport, the element should contain nested elements describing the contained transports,
        if there are any.
        The attributes of a transport element should represent the values of applicable configuration parameters,
        excepting those that are already exposed via :attr:`protocol_parameters` to avoid redundancy.
        The charset is ASCII.

        In general, one can view this as an XML-based representation of a Python constructor invocation expression,
        where the first argument is represented as the XML element data, and all following arguments
        are represented as named XML attributes.
        Examples:

        - ``<can><socketcan mtu="64">vcan0</socketcan></can>``
        - ``<serial baudrate="115200">/dev/ttyACM0</serial>``

        - ``<redundant><udp srv_mult="1">127.0.0.42/8</udp><serial baudrate="115200">COM9</serial></redundant>``

        implementation class and instantiate it from a supplied descriptor. This would benefit transport-agnostic
        applications greatly.
