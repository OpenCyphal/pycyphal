        If the transport does not have a node-ID, this property has the value of None,
        and the transport (and the node that uses it) is said to be in the anonymous mode.

        Activates low-level monitoring of the transport interface.
        Also see related method :meth:`make_tracer`.

        This method puts the transport instance into the low-level capture mode which does not interfere with its
        normal operation but may significantly increase the computing load due to the need to process every frame
        exchanged over the network (not just frames that originate or terminate at the local node).
        This usually involves reconfiguration of the local networking hardware.
        For instance, the network card may be put into promiscuous mode,
        the CAN adapter will have its acceptance filters disabled, etc.

        The capture handler is invoked for every transmitted or received transport frame and, possibly, some
        additional transport-implementation-specific events (e.g., network errors or hardware state changes)
        which are described in the specific transport implementation docs.
        The temporal order of the events delivered to the user may be distorted, depending on the guarantees
        provided by the hardware and its driver.
        This means that if the network hardware sees TX frame A and then RX frame B separated by a very short time
        interval, the user may occasionally see the sequence inverted as (B, A).

        There may be an arbitrary number of capture handlers installed; when a new handler is installed, it is
        added to the existing ones, if any.

        If the transport does not support capture, this method may have no observable effect.
        Technically, the capture protocol, as you can see, does not present any requirements to the emitted events,
        so an implementation that pretends to enter the capture mode while not actually doing anything is compliant.

        Since capture reflects actual network events, deterministic data loss mitigation will make the instance emit
        duplicate frames for affected transfers (although this is probably obvious enough without this elaboration).

        It is not possible to disable capture. Once enabled, it will go on until the transport instance is destroyed.

        :param handler: A one-argument callable invoked to inform the user about low-level network events.
            The type of the argument is :class:`Capture`, see transport-specific docs for the list of the possible
            concrete types and what events they represent.
            **The handler may be invoked from a different thread so the user should ensure synchronization.**
            If the handler raises an exception, it is suppressed and logged.

        Send a spoofed transfer to the network.
        The configuration of the local transport instance has no effect on spoofed transfers;
        as such, even anonymous instances may send arbitrary spoofed transfers.
        The only relevant property of the instance is which network interface to use for spoofing.

        When this method is invoked for the first time, the transport instance may need to perform one-time
        initialization such as reconfiguring the networking hardware or loading additional drivers.
        Once this one-time initialization is performed,
        the transport instance will reside in the spoofing mode until the instance is closed;
        it is not possible to leave the spoofing mode without closing the instance.
        Some transports/platforms may require special permissions to perform spoofing (esp. IP-based transports).

        If the source node-ID is not provided, an anonymous transfer will be emitted.
        If anonymous transfers are not supported, :class:`pyuavcan.transport.OperationNotDefinedForAnonymousNodeError`
        will be raised.
        Same will happen if one attempted to transmit a multi-frame anonymous transfer.

        If the destination node-ID is not provided, a broadcast transfer will be emitted.
        If the data specifier is that of a service, a :class:`UnsupportedSessionConfigurationError` will be raised.
        The reverse conflict for messages is handled identically.

        Transports with cyclic transfer-ID will compute the modulo automatically.
