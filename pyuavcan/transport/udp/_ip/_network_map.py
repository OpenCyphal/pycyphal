    This class encapsulates the logic of mapping between node-ID values and IP addresses.
    The principle is that the node-ID is represented as a contiguous set of least significant bits of
    the node's IP address.

    If the IP address of the local node does not belong to the subnet
    (e.g., if the local IP address is the same as the broadcast address of the subnet,
    or if the value of the host bits does not belong to the set of valid node-ID values),
    the local node is considered to be anonymous.
    Anonymous UDP/IP nodes cannot initiate network exchanges of any kind, they can only listen.

    If none of the available network interfaces have the supplied IP address, the constructor will raise

        Makes a new non-blocking input socket bound to the specified port.
        The required socket options will be set up as needed automatically.
        Timestamping will need to be enabled separately.

        If the "expect broadcast" parameter is True, the bind address may be INADDR_ANY
        in order to allow reception of broadcast datagrams,
        so the user of the socket will have to filter out packets manually in user space;
        the background is explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58118503/1007777.
        If that parameter is False, the socket may be bound to the local IP address,
        which on some OS will make it reject all broadcast traffic.
        The positive side-effect of binding to a specific address instead of INADDR_ANY
        is that on GNU/Linux it will allow multiple processes to bind to and receive unicast
        datagrams from the same port.

        The above distinction between broadcast-capable and not broadcast-capable sockets is
        important for GNU/Linux because sockets bound to INADDR_ANY can receive both broadcast
        and unicast datagrams, but if there is more than one socket on the same port and
        the same interface, only the last bound one will receive unicast traffic::

        The expect-broadcast option allows us to run more than one node on localhost side-by-side,
        which is convenient for testing. Otherwise, each node interested in the same UAVCAN service
        would bind to the same UDP port at INADDR_ANY, and on GNU/Linux the result would be that
        only the latest bound node would be able to receive unicast traffic directed to that port.
        To an outside observer it would appear as if the other nodes just ignore the packets.
        On other operating systems this problem may not exist though.

        :param local_port: The UDP port to bind to (function of the data specifier).
        :param expect_broadcast: If True, the socket shall be able to accept broadcast datagrams.
            If False, acceptance of broadcast datagrams is possible but not guaranteed.
            This option enables certain optimizations depending on the underlying OS.
