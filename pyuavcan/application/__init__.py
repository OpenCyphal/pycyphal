Application layer overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The application module contains the application-layer API.
This module is not imported automatically because it depends on the transpiled DSDL namespace ``uavcan``.
The DSDL namespace can be either transpiled manually or lazily ad-hoc; see :mod:`pyuavcan.dsdl` for related docs.

Classes contained here affect the state of the bus by publishing data, responding to service requests, or otherwise.
It is expected that some applications may need to complete early initialization procedures before
they are ready to begin interaction with the outside world.
Hence, many classes in this module are equipped with a method ``start()``,
which must be invoked once to bring the instance into a functional state.
The instance will remain operational until ``close()`` is invoked on it.
Both methods are idempotent.

The main entity of this module is the class :class:`pyuavcan.application.Node`.
There are several nested submodules,
each dedicated to a particular *application-level function* of the UAVCAN protocol,
such as :mod:`pyuavcan.application.heartbeat_publisher`;
each such module shall be imported explicitly.


Node class
++++++++++

The class :class:`pyuavcan.application.Node` models a UAVCAN node --- it is one of the main entities of the library.
The application uses it to interact with the network: create publications/subscriptions, invoke and serve RPC-services.


Constructing a node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__NODE__ID__NATURAL16"]                   = "42"
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__PUB__MEASURED_VOLTAGE__ID__NATURAL16"]  = "6543"
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__SUB__POSITION_SETPOINT__ID__NATURAL16"] = "6544"
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__SRV__LEAST_SQUARES__ID__NATURAL16"]     = "123"
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__CLN__LEAST_SQUARES__ID__NATURAL16"]     = "123"
    >>> os.environ["UAVCAN__LOOPBACK__BIT"]                         = "1"

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> await_ = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete

Create a node using the factory :meth:`make_node` and start it:

>>> import pyuavcan.application
>>> import uavcan.node                                  # Transcompiled DSDL namespace (see pyuavcan.dsdl).
>>> node_info = pyuavcan.application.NodeInfo(          # This is an alias for uavcan.node.GetInfo.Response.
...     protocol_version=uavcan.node.Version_1_0(*pyuavcan.UAVCAN_SPECIFICATION_VERSION),
...     software_version=uavcan.node.Version_1_0(major=1, minor=0),
...     name="org.uavcan.pyuavcan.docs",
... )
>>> node = pyuavcan.application.make_node(node_info)
>>> node.start()

..  doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> for k in os.environ:
    ...     if "__" in k:
    ...         del os.environ[k]

The node instance we just created will periodically publish ``uavcan.node.Heartbeat``,
respond to ``uavcan.node.GetInfo``,
and do some other standard things -- read the docs for :class:`Node` for details.

Now we can create ports --- that is, instances of
:class:`pyuavcan.presentation.Publisher`,
:class:`pyuavcan.presentation.Subscriber`,
:class:`pyuavcan.presentation.Client`,
:class:`pyuavcan.presentation.Server`
--- to interact with the network.
To create a new port you need to specify its type and name
(the name can be omitted if a fixed port-ID is defined for the data type).


Publishers and subscribers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a publisher and publish a message:

>>> import uavcan.si.unit.voltage
>>> pub_voltage = node.make_publisher(uavcan.si.unit.voltage.Scalar_1_0, "measured_voltage")
>>> pub_voltage.publish_soon(uavcan.si.unit.voltage.Scalar_1_0(402.15))     # Publish message asynchronously.
>>> await_(pub_voltage.publish(uavcan.si.unit.voltage.Scalar_1_0(402.15)))  # Or synchronously.
True

Create a subscription and receive a message from it:

..  doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> import uavcan.si.unit.length
    >>> pub = node.presentation.make_publisher(uavcan.si.unit.length.Vector3_1_0, 6544)
    >>> pub.publish_soon(uavcan.si.unit.length.Vector3_1_0([42.0, 15.4, -8.7]))

>>> import uavcan.si.unit.length
>>> sub_position = node.make_subscriber(uavcan.si.unit.length.Vector3_1_0, "position_setpoint")
>>> msg, metadata = await_(sub_position.receive_for(timeout=0.5))
>>> msg.meter[0], msg.meter[1], msg.meter[2]                            # Some payload in the message we received.
(42.0, 15.4, -8.7)
>>> metadata.source_node_id, metadata.priority, metadata.transfer_id    # Metadata for the message.
(42, <Priority.NOMINAL: 4>, 0)


RPC-service clients and servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define an RPC-service of an application-specific type:

>>> from sirius_cyber_corp import PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0  # An application-specific DSDL definition.
>>> async def solve_linear_least_squares(
...     request: PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0.Request,
...     metadata: pyuavcan.presentation.ServiceRequestMetadata,
... ) -> PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0.Response:                 # Business logic.
...     import numpy as np
...     x = np.array([p.x for p in request.points])
...     y = np.array([p.y for p in request.points])
...     s, *_ = np.linalg.lstsq(np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T, y, rcond=None)
...     return PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0.Response(slope=s[0], y_intercept=s[1])
>>> srv_least_squares = node.get_server(PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0, "least_squares")
>>> srv_least_squares.serve_in_background(solve_linear_least_squares)  # Run the server in a background task.

Invoke the service we defined above assuming that it is served by node 42:

>>> from sirius_cyber_corp import PointXY_1_0
>>> cln_least_sq = node.make_client(PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0, 42, "least_squares")
>>> req = PerformLinearLeastSquaresFit_1_0.Request([PointXY_1_0(10, 1), PointXY_1_0(20, 2)])
>>> response, metadata = await_(cln_least_sq.call(req))
>>> round(response.slope, 1), round(response.y_intercept, 1)
(0.1, 0.0)

Here is another example showcasing the use of a standard service with a fixed port-ID:

>>> client_node_info = node.make_client(uavcan.node.GetInfo_1_0, 42)    # Port name is not required.
>>> response, metadata = await_(client_node_info.call(uavcan.node.GetInfo_1_0.Request()))
>>> response.software_version
uavcan.node.Version.1.0(major=1, minor=0)


Registers and application settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, you are probably wondering, how come we just created a node without specifying which transport it should use,
its node-ID, or even the subject-IDs and service-IDs?
Where did these values come from?

These values were read from from the *registers*, as defined in the UAVCAN Specification
(chapter "Application layer", section "Register interface").
Those familiar with ROS will find similarities with the *ROS Parameter Server*.

The registers are named values that keep various settings and parameters of the node.
The factory :meth:`make_node` we used above just reads the registers and figures out how to construct
the node from that: which transport to use, the node-ID, the subject-IDs, and so on.
Any UAVCAN application is also expected to keep its own configuration parameters in the registers so that
it can be reconfigured and controlled at runtime via UAVCAN.

The registry of the node instance can be accessed via :attr:`Node.registry` which is an instance of
:class:`pyuavcan.application.register.Registry`:

>>> int(node.registry["uavcan.node.id"])        # Standard registers defined by UAVCAN are named like "uavcan.*"
42
>>> node.presentation.transport.local_node_id   # Yup, indeed, the node-ID is picked up from the register.
42
>>> int(node.registry["uavcan.pub.measured_voltage.id"])    # This is where we got the subject-ID from.
6543
>>> pub_voltage.port_id
6543
>>> int(node.registry["uavcan.sub.position_setpoint.id"])   # And so on.
6544
>>> str(node.registry["uavcan.sub.position_setpoint.type"]) # Subscription type is automatically exposed via registry.
'uavcan.si.unit.length.Vector3.1.0'

Every port created by the application (publisher, subscriber, etc.) is automatically exposed via the register
interface to uphold the logic of the register-based UAVCAN introspection API.
The application therefore should not attempt to create new ports using the presentation-layer API because that
would circumvent the introspection services.

The node instance also implements the register network service (``uavcan.register.Access``, ``uavcan.register.List``)
so other network participants can access the registry of the local node and reconfigure it.
The application can also do that locally, of course.
New registers can be created in two ways: by passing defaults to :func:`make_node` (will be shown later),
and via :meth:`Node.new_register` like so:

>>> from pyuavcan.application.register import Value, Real64  # Convenience aliases for uavcan.register.Value, etc.
>>> import numpy as np
>>> node.new_register("my_application.estimator.state_vector",      # Not stored, but computed at every invocation
...                   lambda: Value(real64=Real64(np.random.random((4, 1)).flatten())))
>>> node.registry["my_application.estimator.state_vector"].floats   # Some random things.
[..., ..., ..., ...]

But the above does not explain where did the example get the register values from.
There are three places:

- **The register file** which contains a simple key-value database table.
  If the file does not exist (like at the first run), it is automatically created.
  Multiple processes can use the same time concurrently.
  If no file location is provided when invoking :meth:`make_node`,
  the registry is stored in memory so that all state is lost when the node is closed.

- **The environment variables.**
  The mapping between register names and environment variables is as follows,
  where ``ty`` is the register type like ``string``, ``natural16``, etc.
  (see :mod:`pyuavcan.application.register` for the full list):

  >>> name = 'm.motor.flux_linkage'
  >>> ty = 'real64'
  >>> (name + "." + ty).upper().replace(".", "_" * 2)  # Register --> environment variable name mapping rule.
  'M__MOTOR__FLUX_LINKAGE__REAL64'

  String-typed register values are passed as-is, "unstructured" register values are hex-encoded (aka Base16),
  and numerical values are passed as decimals. Array elements are space-separated.
  For example, register ``m.motor.inductance_dq`` of type ``real64[2]`` and value (0.12, 0.13)
  is passed as an environment variable named ``M__MOTOR__INDUCTANCE_DQ__REAL64`` assigned ``0.12 0.13``.

  When the environment variables are parsed, the values stored in the register file are automatically updated.

- **The schema definition (default values).**
  The application can pass default register values to ensure that the register file contains them and that they are
  of the correct type.
  The defaults are created before the environment variables are parsed to ensure that the registers are of the
  type defined by the application.
  Registers that already exist in the file under a wrong type are automatically converted to
  the correct type defined in the schema.
  Do not use this feature for setting default node-ID or port-IDs.

    >>> for k in os.environ:
    ...     if "__" in k:
    ...         del os.environ[k]
    >>> node.close()

Naturally, in order to launch a node one would need to export the required environment variables.
While this can be done trivially using a shell script or something similar,
we recommend using the UAVCAN orchestrator implemented in the Yakut command-line tool
(those familiar with ROS will find certain parallels with roslaunch).
It allows one to define UAVCAN network configuration in YAML files with first-class support for passing
registers via environment variables.


Application-layer function implementations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As mentioned in the description of the Node class, it provides certain bare-minumum standard application-layer
functionality like publishing heartbeats, responding to GetInfo, serving the register API, etc.
More complex capabilities are to be set up by the user as needed; some of them are:
