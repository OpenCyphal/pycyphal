PyCyphal documentation
======================

PyCyphal is a full-featured implementation of the `Cyphal protocol stack <https://opencyphal.org>`_ in Python.
PyCyphal aims to support all features and transport layers of UAVCAN,
be portable across all major platforms supporting Python, and
be extensible to permit low-effort experimentation and testing of new protocol capabilities.

Start reading this documentation from the first chapter -- :ref:`architecture`.
