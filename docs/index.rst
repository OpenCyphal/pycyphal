PyUAVCAN documentation
======================

PyUAVCAN is a full-featured implementation of the `UAVCAN protocol stack <https://uavcan.org>`_ in Python.
PyUAVCAN aims to support all features and transport layers of UAVCAN,
be portable across all major platforms supporting Python, and
be extensible to permit low-effort experimentation and testing of new protocol capabilities.

Start reading this documentation from the first chapter -- :ref:`architecture`.
If you have questions, please bring them to the `UAVCAN support forum <https://forum.uavcan.org/>`_.
