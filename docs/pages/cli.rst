.. _cli:

Command-line tool
=================

The command-line tool can be invoked using its full name ``pyuavcan``, using the alias ``uvc``,
or by explicitly invoking the Python package as ``python -m pyuavcan``.

There is an unlisted optional dependency ``coloredlogs``.
As the name suggests, if this library is installed, the log messages emitted into stderr by the CLI tool
will be nicely colored.

The information contained below can also be accessed via ``--help``.
